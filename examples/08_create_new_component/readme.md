# Example 08: Create a New Component

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to create and integrate a new component into the `EnCoDaPy` framework. The new component is defined in the `new_component` module and includes its configuration, input, and output models. The example also shows how to use the `ComponentRunnerService` to run the component.

## Prerequisites

Before running this example, ensure you have the following:

- Python environment set up with all dependencies installed.
- A `.env` file in the root directory with the possibly necessary environment variables.

## Environment Variables

As this example component is configured using the MQTT and file interface, the environment variables that could be required for this example can be found in [example 05](./../05_simple_service_mqtt/). The following variables are required, though some are optional:
    ```.env
    LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG" # if you need more logs
    PATH_OF_INPUT_FILE = "./input_data.csv" # inputs via file

    MQTT_BROKER="localhost"  # URL of the MQTT Broker / default value
    MQTT_PORT=1883           # Port of the MQTT Broker / default value
    MQTT_USERNAME=""         # if required / default value
    MQTT_PASSWORD=""         # if required / default value
    MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX=""     # optional, used as prefix for all topics  / default value
    LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"      # Level for Logging Messages ("DEBUG" to get more information) / default value
    CONFIG_PATH="config.json"  # Path to the configuration directory / default value
    ```
As MQTT is used as the interface, you will need a running MQTT broker.

## Structure

The example consists of the following files:

- [new_component.py](./new_component/new_component.py): Defines the NewComponent class. (Note the CamelCase notation of the class)
- [new_component_config.py](./new_component/new_component_config.py): Defines the configuration, input, and output models for the new component.
- [config.json](./new_component/config.json): Example configuration for the service, including the new component.
- [main.py](main.py): Entry point to run the example service.
- [input_data.csv](./input_data.csv): Input data via file

## Usage

Ensure the .env file is correctly configured.

Run the example using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
